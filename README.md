# AudioRecorder 🎤
An app that allows users to record and play sounds. </br>
In this project, I have focused mainly on AVFoundation and making UI only programmatically. </br>
The app saves recording on local storage using FileManager and USerDefaults. </br>

## Demo of an app

<img src="readme_files/rec_demo.gif" alt="demo_gif" width="736"/> </br>

However, gif doesn't support sounds so I encurage everybody to try this app on their device 🥰.

Made with ♥️ in Swift.
