# AudioRecorder 🎤
App that allows user to record and play sounds. </br>
In this project I have focused mainly about AVFoundation and making UI only programatically. </br>
App saves recording on local storage using FileManager and USerDefaults. </br>

## Demo of an app

<img src="readme_files/rec_demo.gif" alt="demo_gif" width="736"/> </br>

Hoever gif doesnt support sounds so I encurage everybody to try this app on own device 🥰.

Made with ♥️ in Swift.
